<h2>Brief Description of our project</h2>


<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome to our relativistic interactive three body problem simulation project for McGill Physics Hackathon 2021! Here we implement Post-Newtonian/relativistic corrections to the orbit of each planet. In addition, we also explore the gravitational waves spectrum emission for each particle in an intuitive windowed interface built with PyQT5.
</p>
<h2> Prerequisites </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"> To run our simulator you need a couple of prerequisites (matplotlib, scipy, PyQt5, numpy). The best way to install them is by using pip (if you do not have pip installed on your computer, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/">this link</a>) via the command
  
  <ul>
  <li> pip install matplotlib scipy pyqt5 numpy </li>
    
</ul>
or
<ul>
    <li> pip3 install matplotlib scipy pyqt5 numpy </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
if you have both python2 and python3 on your personal machine.
After installing the prerequisites, you only need to download our main code from the github repository via 

<ul>
    <li> git clone https://github.com/mcgill3body/3bodyrelativistic </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

and run the main code via "python 3_body_newton.py".
<h2>Manual of our simulator </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"> We've made one intuitive interactive window so that you can focus primarily on the physics of the problem. You can select one of our preconfigured orbits (from stable and famous
configurations such as the figure 8 to marginally stable (M) and unstable orbits (U)) in the first box of our panel. The code takes about 10-15 seconds to solve the differential equations and plot it on the main pannel.
You can then watch the simulation until the end, or select "Stop simulation" to test other configurations. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> In the main pannel you'll be able to see the famous classical orbits obtained only from Newton's equations of gravity side-by-side with the orbits obtained
  with the relativistic corrections via the Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations. The orbit plots aren't fixed in order to encourage exploring different points of view from the orbits:
 just click and drag the mouse around the orbits in each plot. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> You can also have fun by selecting specific masses for each body and clicking the button "Ready, Set, Go!" to generate a randomized configuration (for position and velocity) with the choosen masses.
</p>
This isn't the end of the story! There are a plethora of orbits at reference 4 where you can explore our source code if you want to make adptations.

<p>
  The three-body problem is famous for being a chaotic system without analytical solution. A simple example of three-body systems is
  the description of the Earth-Sun-Jupiter orbits. Usually in this type of situation, physicists ignore the mass of the Earth, since both
  Jupiter and the Sun are more massive. Another three-body system that is usually approximated to a two body system is the Alpha Centauri star system.
  The system is composed of Alpha Centauri A, B and C. However, Alpha Centauri C (also known as Proxima Centauri) mass is only 0.122 solar masses
  (denoted by \(M_\odot\) ), while the masses of Alpha Centauri A and B are 1.1 \(M_\odot\) and 0.907 \(M_\odot\), respectively. Furthermore, Proxima Centauri
  appears to be far away from the first two, not influencing their dynamics significantly. The system is then approximated to a binary sistem of Alpha
  Centauri A and B (See ref [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9609106"> 1</a>] for more details).<br>

  In this project, we do not wish to work with this approximation. That means we need to solve numerically the system of coupled equations in order to extract
  the orbits of the bodies. The equation of motion of each \(i\)-th body in the system is given by the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equation [<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1968714">2</a>]
  
  \[ \vec{a}_i = \sum_{i \neq j}{G m_j \vec{n}_{ij} \over r_{ij}^2} + {1 \over c^2} \sum_{i \neq j} {G m_j \vec{n}_{ij} \over r_{ij}^2} {\left[v_{i}^2 + 2v_{j}^2
  - 4 \left( \vec{v}_i \cdot \vec{v}_j \right) - {3 \over 2} \left( \vec{n}_{ij} \cdot \vec{v}_j \right)^2 - 4 \sum_{k \neq i} {G m_k \over r_{ik}} - \right.}\]
  \[{\left. - \sum_{j \neq k} {G m_k \over r_{jk}} + {1 \over 2} \left( \left( \vec{r}_j - \vec{r}_i \right) \cdot \vec{a}_j \right) \right]} + {1 \over c^2}
  \sum_{i \neq j} {G m_j \over r_{ij}^2} \left[ \vec{n}_{ij} \cdot \left(4 \vec{v}_i - 3 \vec{v}_j \right) \right] \left( \vec{v}_i - \vec{v}_j \right) + \]
  \[+ {7 \over 2 c^2} \sum_{i \neq j} {G m_j \vec{a}_{j} \over r_{ij}^2} + \mathcal{O}\left( c^{-4} \right)\]
  
  This is a pretty complicated equation, the acceleration of the \(i\)-th body depends on the acceleration of the others \(j\)-th bodies and it
  also depends on the velocities and the positions of all other \(j\)-th bodies, where \(i \neq j\). In our case, the total number of orbiting bodies is 3. The
  \(\vec{n}_{ij}\) vector is the unit vector pointing from the \(i\)-th body to the \(j\)-th body. We then have 3 equations like this one, one for each body.<br>
  <br>
  
  In order to solve all three equations, we set initial conditions and the constant parameters (\(G, m_1, m_2, m_3\)). Since this is a relativistic problem, we may
  expect some gravitation waves being emitted from the orbital motion of the three bodies (just like the two black holes merger that provided the first gravitational
  wave detection [<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102">3</a>]). The emission of gravitational waves close to the emitting source
  is a very complex problem. In our project, we are interested in how we see this gravitational waves from a frame of reference far way from the source. We may think
  of this consideration as equivallent to measuring gravitational waves here on Earth from the other side of the galaxy. Therefore, we may consider only the first
  order of approximation from the multipole expansion using perturbation theory.
  
  When considering the emission of gravitational waves, we are talking about a perturbation on the metric tensor \(g_{\mu \nu}\) that describes space-time
  
  \[G_{\mu \nu} = {8 \pi \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu} \]
  
  where the metric is contained inside \(G_{\mu \nu}\). We first...
  
  \[g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + h_{\mu \nu} \]
  
  Then mathemagic happens and boom
