<h1>Hi and Welcome! :) </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify"> I'm a physics master's student at (<a href="https://www2.ifsc.usp.br/english/">IFSC</a>) at the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil, currently working on the study of spin liquids using numerical and analytical techniques such as the Variational Monte Carlo and mean field theories. In general, my research interests lie on understanding how complex and unique phenomena may emerge from interactions between <i>(almost)</i> fundamental blocks of nature, i.e., quasiparticles and particles; for this challenging endeavor, we use established theoretical and computational methods in physics.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> For educational purposes, after working with a diverse public for five years I discovered that I really enjoy teaching and developing innovative solutions for teaching physics in a more interesting way. There's nothing better than kindly helping others through education. Apart from Academia and in a methodological sense, software development and data analysis in a broader scope are 'my cup of tea'.   </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I started my studies in Physics at the University of Brasília (<a href="https://international.unb.br/">UNB</a>) , Brazil in June of 2015 and ended it in December 2019. I had the opportunity to work on different year-long projects, approaching themes including:

</p>

<ul>
<li>Photo-fragmentation of amino acids from synchrotron radiation using Time-of-flight spectroscopy;</li>
<li>
Optimization of potential energy curves for diatomic molecules in atomic and molecular physics via genetic algorithms;</li>
<li>Derivation from first principles of the Schrödinger Equation for a particular interpretation of Quantum Mechanics;</li>
<li>Particle physics phenomena in the context of quantum field theory in curved spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>I graduated in 2019, with an <a href="../publications#tcc">Undergraduate Dissertation</a> focused on understanding the influence of the Unruh Effect on particle physics phenomena and related topics on the semiclassical approach of QFT in curved spaces.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Since January 2020, I'm working with spin liquids in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/castroeandrade"> Eric C. Andrade's group </a>at the University of São Paulo, São Carlos, Brazil.  Here's a brief summary of what I've been learning:
</p>

We investigate how spin liquids can be understood over the scope of Parton construction and projected wave functions. The main idea is to decompose the spin degrees of freedom into bosonic or fermionic (Dirac or Majorana) ones constrained by a physical condition of no double occupancy on the physical Hilbert space (Figure 1 on the left). Although Mean field theories are restrictive in the sense that the physical constraint is only imposed on average in the decoupling procedure, they are used to motivate the possible ansätze that may describe the physical ground state of a system described by an effective Hamiltonian motivated by experiments. Numerical techniques such as the Variational Monte Carlo are interesting since they impose the condition exactly at each site, furnishing an environment to learn about competitive phases on frustrated magnetism. We are applying these techniques to a putative chiral spin liquid on the kagome lattice in a collaboration with <a href="https://www.iip.ufrn.br/qiqm/people/our-group/rodrigo-pereira/"> Rodrigo Pereira's group </a> at IIP, Natal.
