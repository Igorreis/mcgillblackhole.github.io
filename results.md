<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome to our relativistic interactive three body problem simulation project for McGill Physics Hackathon 2021! Here we implement Post-Newtonian/relativistic corrections to the orbit of each planet. In addition, we also explore the gravitational waves spectrum emission for each particle in an intuitive windowed interface built with PyQT5.
